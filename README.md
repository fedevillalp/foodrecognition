# FOOD RECOGNITION AND NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION

This app recognizes the ingredients present in a food image and returns its nutritional information. It uses the Clarify machine learning API (food model) to recognize the base ingredients in a picture. Soon after it makes an API call to Nutritinoix and provides a table with the nutritional information of the ingredients that were identified.
